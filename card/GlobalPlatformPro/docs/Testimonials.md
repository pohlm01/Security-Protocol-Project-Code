# Feedback from users

Both developers and end-users like the simplicity and usability of GlobalPlatformPro. Here are some testimonials.

> Been in the smartcard consumption and coding business for a number of years. Your tool GlobalPlatformPro is just the best as benchmark for applet management. Thanks for such a cool tool.

> We have been using gpshell to manipulate contents of JCOP cards but we needed something that works with new smart cards / protocols and also something we can  integrate with our PC/SC stack. We tried GlobalPlatformPro and we never looked  back. We can easily tweak bits we need - like a command line switch for our PC/SC TerminalFactory.

> We are very happy with this tool. Well done Martin, thanks!

> I've just been trying out your latest version and it certainly lives up to your claims. It is very much easier to use than GPShell and does a much better job of detecting card and key information automatically.

>  I had to rely on GlobalPlatform Card in general for past smart card projects since GP is the defacto standard for managing Java Card Applets. GPShell was the closest implementation that was somewhat open source and command-line based. I liked GlobalPlatformPro design even more and it feels like a POSIX classic (i.e. small, simple and composable and does GP operations very well). It's the tool I wished I had the time to build myself. Definitely an indespensable smart card tool moving forward.
